What is DNSMasq?
Dnsmasq is a lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server. 
It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a small network. 
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. 
The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated
addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a
central configuration file.
